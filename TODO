  content_types_accepted: @model.update(params, blob) - update vs. create?

Other concerns:
Content type handling (iow: RDF<->text format)

Content encoding (gzip, compress)

Exception handling

HTML related:
  Method coercion (POST that means DELETE/PUT)
  Params -> graph
  Form rendering

Cacheing - last_modified, expires, etag(+ W/)

Blending concern-focused modules e.g. content_types_accepted - quality metrics,
accept variants...  variance, conflict, options are related to the above (i.e.
blended concerns)

collect vocabs used to generate a graph - build curies for representations that work that way

BGP queries should be solveable *across* resources - currently all patterns get
a :context variable applied that all have to match, but it seems reasonable
that multiple resources might participate in a solution.

*** Pure Mad Science ***

Single Graph Update
client should be able to alter the graph as needed, build
a single sub-graph that contains all their modifications, and PUT the graph to
a single resource. With parcelling, it's reasonable to break the graph up and
distribute to Resource models, but the challenge is at the If-Modified-Since
step: the graph has to be broken up, and we have to check the Modified time of
all concerned resources.  (Although existing Parcel.resources_for() works...)

There also doesn't seem to be a way to manage Etag If-Mod behavior...

We'd have to collect error messages and decide which status takes precedence



Statistical Front Loading
based on human definitions of resource graphs, and
emperical collection of client behavior (e.g. GET resourceB, Referer:
resourceA, (X-)Triggering-Property: propC), determine properties to front-load
into requests for resourceA to reduce the likelihood of subsequent request for
B. Contributing factors include the size of the extra data, impact on cacheing,
actual impact on subsequent requests (since propC shadows some non-negative
number of other properties we need about resourceB.)

Consider case of an list of users page - client wants names and roles for all
users. So UserList -> User1,User2,User3 etc because of foaf:name and also
authn:role. Once we front load both foaf:name and authn:name, UserList ->
User17, because that's the particular user we want. But: foaf:name makes not
impact by itself (except to change the triggering property), and both aren't an
absolute impact. On the other extreme, front-loading everything from User into
UserList probably stops requests for User17, but the network transfer is
greater as a result.

Certainly, there's a tendancy for everything to be front loaded, and as clients
change we might need to experimentally roll back a front-loading to see if that
triggers more requests.
