    # Property definitions
    property :authorizedBy, :comment =>
      %(Opaque descriptors of authorization tokens - resource can be
        dereferenced by users with that token. It's recommended that
        the tokens be defreferenceable, and that they be accessible
        iff the user is authorized to activate the affordance in
        question.)
    property :controlName, :comment =>

        used as the property in a statement)
    property :pattern, :comment =>
      %(An IRITemplate \(RFC 5xxx\) that defines how the template is
        rendered - implicitly, all the parameters of the template are
        provided as a key, value set called param_list, so something
        like \(?param_list*\) should work like an HTML action=GET form)
    property :payload

      %(Used to indicate that a resource template can be used as the
        property in a statement)

      %(Used to indicate that a resource template can be used as the
        subject in a statement)

      %(Could be a templated URL, or a URL resource. If not a
        template, but the Affordance has one or more uriVariable
        properties, the implication is that the target resource should
        be used as the basis of a URI template by appending
        \(?name,other,...\) to the URI.)
    property :var, :comment =>
      %(When the object is list, the members of the list should be
        Parameters, the the list order implies the order in which the
        parameters should be used)
