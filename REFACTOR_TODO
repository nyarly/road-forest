SourceSkepticism -> SourceRigor

GraphManager -> ?MetaGraph ?ProvenanceGraph

GraphManager shouldn't handle GraphFocuses directly. i.e. GM#start should be
removed.
GraphFocus should either take args to ::new or yield self

Tests on the server side

Every method in RDF::Normalization

GraphFocus:
  source
  root_url

RemoteHost should be the origin of most of config (see API)

Starting at GraphFocus (or before) subject, source_skepticism<sub(rigor)>,
graph_transfer should be bundled into a single object, passed down by GF

GraphManager: remove #start (used currently in specs), remove local context

Concrete plan for relocation:

road-forest/name.rb reserved for API entry points
  road-forest/remote-host.rb
  road-forest/application.rb
  road-forest/model.rb

road-forest/<dir> for components
  road-forest/test-support/
  road-forest/rdf/
    graph-focus
    meta-graph.rb
    source-rigor.rb
    source-rigor/
  road-forest/application/
  road-forest/content-handling/
    media-type
    (encoding, charset)
  road-forest/http/
    maybe someday: road-forest/wire/http (& .../wire/zmq|ssh|serial)
