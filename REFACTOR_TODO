GraphStore: remove #start (used currently in specs), remove local context
GraphStore shouldn't handle GraphFocuses directly. i.e. GM#start should be
removed.
GraphFocus should either take args to ::new or yield self

Tests on the server side

Every method in RDF::Normalization

GraphFocus:
  source
  root_url

RemoteHost should be the origin of most of config (see API)

Starting at GraphFocus (or before) subject, source_rigor,
graph_transfer should be bundled into a single object, passed down by GF
