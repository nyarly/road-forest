GraphStore: remove #start (used currently in specs), remove local context
GraphStore shouldn't handle GraphFocuses directly. i.e. GM#start should be
removed.

GraphFocus should either take args to ::new or yield self

GraphStore: remote _:local context

Tests on the server side

Every method in RDF::Normalization

RemoteHost should be the origin of most of config (see API)

Split GraphFocus class heirarchy into Client and Common - client includes
GraphStore/SourceRigor stuff, Common is just graph walking and convenience.
