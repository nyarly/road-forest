Roadforest needs a set of vocabularies in order to function Correctly

(RF clients and servers can agree to proper use, but the ideal would be a real
hypermedia framework, so)

And affordances vocab
  There are several close to the mark - notably Hydra, but they tend to specify
  HTTP, which seems like an over-commit

Would like to support the full MCA HFactor suite
  http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/hfactor/

  * Templated Navigation
  * Embedded
  * Idempotence
  * Updates
  * Method (or its proxy)
  * Read control (change Accept-)
  * Update control (change Content-)
  * Link relations (satisfied by RDF)

Would like to further have an authorization component to affordance

So: Affordable looks like:

Affordance a rdfs:Class

SafeAffordance

NavigationAffordance a rdfs:Class
  subClassOf SafeAffordance
EmbedAffordance
  subClassOf SafeAffordance

IdempotentAffordance

  dereferenced by users with that token

target a rdf:Property

  comment Could be a templated URL

uriVariable a rdf:Property
  domain Affordance
  range Parameter

payload a rdf:Property
  domain Affordance
  range Term
  comment Points to a node in an isolated graph that describes the possible
    payload of the affordance. Graph might need a different entailment -
    allowing e.g. a blank node to be the object of a property whose domain is
    Literal... i.e. only using RDF entailment, not RDFS

Parameter a rdfs:Class

name a rdf:Property
  domain Parameter
  range Literal

range a rdf:Property
  domain Parameter
  range Class
